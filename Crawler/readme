Crawler.java:

Pre-requisite:
add your database name, username and password in the string Connection before main.
remove or correctly change the package name to work on your project
Add a folder "html_docs" in your local project directory
Docs_URL table created in ms sql - run the Docs_URL.sql in your database ( ** check the updated schema !)

The current version uses a class: CustomURL - make sure it is in the same package to work properly !
